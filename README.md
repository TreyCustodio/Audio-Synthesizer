# Composer-Synthesizer
A music composition and sound synthesizer tool
designed by Trey Custodio

I am designing this tool so that I can:
<br>(1) compose music
<br>(2) produce instrumentals
<br>(3) create cool video game sound effects

<br>

##  Composer
### Main Use Cases
- Compose music by defining a bpm
- Use the bpm to combine notes of varying lengths

### Future Implementations
- a UI that allows you to compose music by drawing notes onto sheet music


##  Synthesizer
### Main Use Cases
- Produce new sounds with various mathematical manipulations
- Save your new instruments and create music with them using the Composer tool

### Future Implementations
- Dynamically generated sounds
- a piano player UI that allows you to play your synthesized sounds for your homies
