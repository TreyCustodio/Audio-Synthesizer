# Audio Module
A sound effect generator that I am designing so that I can produce music and create cool video game sfx.

# Current Instruments
- These instruments are defined in instruments.py using the functions defined in audio.py
<br>

##  (1) Pluck Family
- Punchy, stringy sounds defined by a note that is distorted and a lower harmonic

###  Pluck
- 2 harmonics: 1 defined by the base note, and another that is 1 octave lower.


<br><br>

##  (2) Drum Family
- Powerful, punchy, percussive sounds defined by a very fast attack, decay, and release

###  Skirts
- a snare with a metallicy twang. Great for keeping tempo


<br><br>

##  (3) Xylophone Family
- Defined by a bass note and 2 higher harmonics
- Manipulate the other 2 harmonics to achieve different sounds

###  Xylophone
- a xylophone sound, 3 harmonics

###  XyloTech
- a techno sounding instrument that is great for poppy club beats

##  (4) Piano Family
- My attempt at mimicking the sound of a piano.
- Different implementations will demonstrate different fingerings by combining harmonics.
