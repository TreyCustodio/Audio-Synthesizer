#   Notes for different sound effects

##  Warping Sound
- create a bass snare sound (low frequency, high decrement)
- invert the sound and repeat it

##  Staticcy / Electric Sounds
- add noise before adding a high distortion

##  Scats and Slashes
- create a wave with nearly 0 frequency
- add white noise to it
- add some distortion for different effects

##  Thuds
- Start with any frequency
- pitch envelope close to 0
- put a snare envelope on
- increase frequency for lighter thuds
- decrease for deeper bass drums

##  Skit / Skurts
- start with a nigh-0 frequency wave
- add some white noise
- add a high distortion
- lower the amplitude

##  Guitar Sounds
- combine pluck sounds
- one higher, one lower
- distort them both

##  Textbox / Speech Sounds
- first create a string sound
- then wrap it in a snare envelope
- combine multiple for unique effects
